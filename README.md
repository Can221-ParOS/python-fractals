# python-fractals
A collection of python scripts that procedurally draws complex fractals using the Turtle module. (They take a long time to draw due to the complexity, some around 30 minutes)

Make sure to clone the repository in your $HOME directory for the " fractals " command to work if you put it in a /bin symlink

A video example of the generation can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26O8Vx84TBk

to run them, cd into the python-fractals directory,
use the " chmod + * " command to make the scripts executable

then run the menu using " ./pyfracs "

the " fractals " script can be moved to a custom bin path (such as ~/bin such as on my setup) and used to run the program using a standard linux command.
