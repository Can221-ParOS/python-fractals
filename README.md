# python-fractals
A collection of python scripts that procedurally draws complex fractals using the Turtle module. (They take a long time to draw due to the complexity, at most 30 minutes; kofrac takes 40 minutes due to the large amount of shapes to draw)

to run them, cd into the python-fractals directory,
use the 'chmod +x (filename)' command to make them executable
then run them using './(filename)'

for example

chmod +x fracs                       
./fracs
